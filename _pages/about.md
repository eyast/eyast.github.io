I am a Software Architect in the Solutions Acceleration Team - a division within the Industry Solutions organization - at Microsoft. It's a fancy way to say that I build patterns and software artefacts with reusability in mind, typically to help advance the adoption of cloud technologies at scale at large organizations.

I am a student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, where I'm studying towards a Master of Data Science and Leadership (exp 2023). I am intrigued in complexity, decision making under uncertainty, and the visual arts.

I have over 15 years of experience providing hands-on consultation and leadership in the IT sector with a [proven track record](https://www.linkedin.com/in/etaifour/) leading and delivering successful engagements for some of the largest and most complex security and infrastructure problems involving Microsoft technologies.
